concurrently so that the drug may be discontinued as soon as possible if less potentially dangerous agents are indicated by such tests the decision to continue use of chloramphenicol rather than another antibiotic when both are suggested by in vitro studies to be effective against a specific pathogen should be based upon severity of the infection susceptibility of the pathogen to the various

mgkgday divided at 6 hour intervals is effective against most susceptible organisms severe infections eg bacteremia or meningitis especially when adequate cerebrospinal fluid concentrations are

for acute disorders up to 120 mgday deflazacort may need to be given initially maintenance doses in most conditions are within the range of 318 mgday
rheumatoid arthritis the maintenance dose is usually within the range of 318 mgday the smallest effective dose should be used and increased if necessary
bronchial asthma in the treatment of an acute attack high doses of 4872 mgday may be needed depending on severity and gradually reduced once the attack has been controlled for maintenance in chronic asthma doses should be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms
other conditions the dose of deflazacort depends on clinical need titrated to the lowest effective dose for maintenance starting doses may be estimated on the basis of ratio of 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone to 6 mg

children there has been limited exposure of children to deflazacort in clinical trials in children the indications for glucocorticoids arethe same as for adults but it is important that the lowest effective dosage is used alternate day administration may be appropriate doses of deflazacort usually lie in the range 02515 mgkgday the following ranges provide general guidance

juvenile chronic arthritis the usual maintenance dose is between 02510 mgkgday

do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks decreases in dose can occur more frequently avoid frequent dose adjustments
if the hemoglobin rises rapidly eg more than 1 gdl in any 2week period reduce the dose of erythropoietin alfa by 25 or more as needed to reduce rapid responses
for patients who do not respond adequately if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 gdl after 4 weeks of therapy increase the dose by 25
for patients who do not respond adequately over a 12week escalation period increasing the erythropoietin alfa dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for rbc transfusions evaluate other causes of anemia discontinue erythropoietin alfa if responsiveness does not improve

for patients with ckd on dialysis

initiate erythropoietin alfa treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 gdl

for patients with ckd not on dialysis consider initiating erythropoietin alfa treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 gdl and the following considerations apply

the rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a rbc transfusion and
reducing the risk of alloimmunization andor other rbc transfusionrelated risks is a goal
if the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 gdl reduce or interrupt the dose of erythropoietin alfa and use the lowest dose of erythropoietin alfa sufficient to reduce the need for rbc transfusions

if hemoglobin does not increase after 8 weeks of therapy increase erythropoietin alfa dose by approximately 50 to 100 unitskg at 4 to 8week intervals until hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid rbc transfusions or 300 unitskg
withhold erythropoietin alfa if hemoglobin exceeds 12 gdl resume therapy at a dose 25 below the previous dose when hemoglobin declines to less than 11 gdl
discontinue erythropoietin alfa if an increase in hemoglobin is not achieved at a dose of 300 unitskg for 8 weeks

patients on cancer chemotherapy initiate erythropoietin alfa in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 gdl and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy use the lowest dose of erythropoietin alfa necessary to avoid rbc transfusions

starting dose the initial dose of fentanyl should be 100 mcg
redosing patients within a single episode  dosing may be repeated once during a single episode of breakthrough pain if pain is not adequately relieved by one fentanyl dose redosing may occur 30 minutes after the start of administration of fentanyl and the same dosage strength should be used
increasing the dose  titration should be initiated using multiples of the 100 mcg fentanyl tablet patients require to titrate above 100 mcg can be instructed to use two 100 mcg tablets one on each side of the mouth in the buccal cavity if this dose is not successful in controlling the breakthrough pain episode the patient may be instructed to place two 100 mcg tablets on each side of the mouth in the buccal cavity total of four 100 mcg tablets titrate above 400 mcg by 200 mcg increments bearing in mind using more than 4 tablets simultaneously has not been studied and it is important to minimize the number of strengths available to patients at any time to prevent confusion and possible overdose to reduce the risk of overdose during titration patients should have only one strength of fentanyl tablet available at any one time
dosage adjustment generally the dose of fentanyl should be increased when patients require more than one dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes

injection

fentanyl injection can be administered intravenously either as a bolus or by infusion  by intramuscular route also the dose of fentanyl should be individualized according to age body weight physical status underlying pathological condition use of other drugs and type of surgery and anesthesia


doses in excess of 200mcg are for use in anesthesia only as a premedicant 12 ml fentanyl may be given intramuscularly 45 minutes before induction of anesthesia after iv administration in unpremedicated adult patients 2ml fentanyl may be expected to provide sufficient analgesia for 1020 minutes in surgical procedures involving low pain intensity 10 ml fentanyl injected as a bolus gives analgesia lasting about one hour the analgesia produced is sufficient for surgery involving moderately painful procedures giving a dose of 50mcglkg fentanyl will provide intense analgesia for some four to six hours for intensely stimulating surgery


fentanyl may also be given as an infusion in ventilated patients a loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a fast infusion of approximately 1 mcgkgmin for the first 10 minutes followed by an infusion of approximately 01 mcgkgmin alternatively the loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a bolus infusion rates should be titrated to individual patient response lower infusion rates may be adequate unless it is planned to ventilate post operatively the infusion should be terminated at about 40 minutes before the end of surgery


lower infusion rates eg 005008 mcgkgmin are necessary if spontaneous ventilation is to be maintained higher infusion rates up to 3 mcgkgmin have been used in cardiac surgery fentanyl is chemically incompatible with the induction agents thiopentone  methohexitone because of wide differences in ph


use in elderly and debilitated patients it is wise to reduce the dosage in the elderly and debilitated patients the effect of the initial dose should be taken into account in determining supplemental doses

in the male male infertility treatment in combination with hcg induction of spermatogenesis in men deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophichypogonadism",there are great interand intraindividual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous gonadotrophins this makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme the dosage should therefore be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response this requires ultrasonography and monitoring of oestradiol levels there should be consideration to minimize the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation fsh can be given either alone or in combination with a gnrh analogue to prevent premature luteinisation in the latter case especially when using a gnrh agonist a higher total treatment dose of fsh may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response clinical experience with fsh is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafterovulation induction in women starting daily dose of 50 international units iu of fsh is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly for at least the first 7 days the dose is increased by 25 or 50 international units iu at weekly intervals until follicular growth andor serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate response when an acceptable preovulatory state is achieved final oocyte maturation is achieved with 5000 to 10000 international units iu of human chorionic gonadotropin hcg the woman and her partner should have intercourse daily beginning on the day prior to the administration of hcg and until ovulation becomes apparentassisted reproductive technology art in women starting dose of 150 to 225 international units iu of fsh is administered intramuscularly for at least the first 4 days of treatment subsequent doses are adjusted based upon ovarian response as determined by ultrasound evaluation of follicular growth and serum estradiol levels final oocyte maturation is induced with a dose of 500010000 international units of hcg oocyte egg retrieval is performed 34 to 36 hours later polycystic ovarian hyperstimulation pcos fsh injections are therefore given each morning as an intramuscular injection it is best to start with the lowest dose of fsh per day using 50 iu per day these doses are used for 4 to 6 days at a time the ovarian response is determined by measuring oestrogen levels in the blood when the oestrogen begins to rise the fsh is successfully growing an egg or eggs if there is no response to a dose of fsh in 5 6 days of injections the dose will be increased the normal dose increments are 75 units 112 units 150 units and 225 units per day most patients respond with 75 to 150 iu per day however it is very important that increments are only made cautiouslydosage in male induction of spermatogenesis in men pretreatment with hcg alone 1500 international units iu twice weekly is required if serum testosterone levels have not normalized after 8 weeks of hcg treatment the dose may be increased to 3000 international units iu twice a week after normalization of serum testosterone levels administer 450 international units iu per week 225 international units twice weekly or 150 international units iu three times weekly of fsh subcutaneously with the same pretreatment hcg dose used to normalize testosterone level,fsh sometimes excites the ovaries too much this may cause pelvic pain or breathing problems it may also make you urinate less in rare cases patients with this problem have had serious lung problems including fluid in the lungs troublebreathing and worsening of asthma blood clots and strokes severe pelvic pain chest pain or abdominal pain nausea vomiting sudden weight gain bloating trouble breathing fsh may cause twins or multiple births the most common side effects with fsh are headache vaginal bleeding nausea and hot flashes sometimes there is a reaction at the spot where you give yourself the injection this can include bruising pain or redness,no data on acute toxicity of fsh in humans is available but the acute toxicity of fsh and of urinary gonadotrophin preparations in animal studies has been shown to be very low too high a dosage of fsh may lead to hyperstimulation of the

alternateday therapy adt alternateday therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning the purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring longterm pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids white minimizing certain undesirable effects including pituitaryadrenal suppression cushingoid stats corficoid withdrawal symptoms and growth suppression in childrenthe following should be kept in mind when considering alternateday therapy

basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied
alternateday therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom longterm pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated
in less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternateday therapy more severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process the initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases

control in certain acute hypotensive states eg pheochromocytomectomy sympathectomy poliomyelitis spinal anesthesia myocardial infarction septicemia blood transfusion and drug reactions as an adjunct in the treatment of cardiac arrest and profound hypotension,an infusion of norepinephrine should be given into a large vein restoration of blood pressure in acute hypotensive states blood volume depletion should always be corrected as fully as possible before any vasopressor is administered when as an emergency measure intraaortic pressures must be maintained to prevent cerebral or coronary artery ischemia norepinephrine can be administered before and concurrently with blood volume replacement diluent norepinephrine should be diluted in 5 percent dextrose injection or 5 percent dextrose and sodium chloride injections these dextrose containing fluids are protection against significant loss of potency due to oxidation administration in saline solution alone is not recommended whole blood or plasma if indicated to increase blood volume should be administered separately for example by use of a ytube and individual containers if given simultaneously average dosage add the content of the ampoule 4 mg4 ml of norepinephrine to 1000 ml of a 5 percent dextrose containing solution each ml of this dilution contains 4 mcg of the base of norepinephrine give this solution by intravenous infusion insert a plastic intravenous catheter through a suitable bore needle well advanced centrally into the vein and securely fixed with adhesive tape avoiding if possible a catheter tiein technique as this promotes stasis an iv drip chamber or other suitable metering device is essential to permit an accurate estimation of the rate of flow in drops per minute after observing the response to an initial dose of 2 ml to 3 ml from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base per minute adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low normal blood pressure usually 80 mm hg to 100 mm hg systolic sufficient to maintain the circulation to vital organs in previously hypertensive patients it is recommended that the blood pressure should be raised no higher than 40 mm hg below the preexisting systolic pressure the average maintenance dose ranges from 05 ml to 1 ml per minute from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base high dosage in all cases dosage of norepinephrine should be titrated according to the response of the patient occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses as high as 68 mg base or 17 ampoules may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present central venous pressure monitoring is usually helpful in detecting and treating this situation fluid intake the degree of dilution depends on clinical fluid volume requirements if large volumes of fluid dextrose are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per ml should be used on the other hand when large volumes of fluid are clinically undesirable a concentration greater than 4 mcg per ml may be necessary duration of therapy the infusion should be continued until adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained without therapy infusions of norepinephrine should be reduced gradually avoiding abrupt withdrawal in some of the reported cases of vascular collapse due to acute myocardial infarction treatment was required for up to six daysadjunctive treatment in cardiac arrest infusions of norepinephrine are usually administered intravenously during cardiac resuscitation to restore and maintain an adequate blood pressure after an effective heartbeat and ventilation have been established by other means norepinephrine powerful betaadrenergic stimulating action is also thought to increase the strength and effectiveness of systolic contractions once they occur average dosage to maintain systemic blood pressure during the management of cardiac arrest norepinephrine is used in the same manner as described under restoration of blood pressure in acute hypotensive states do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or

as adjunctive therapy in the management of incomplete or inevitable abortion 

in postpartum 

oxytocin is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labor and to control postpartum bleeding or hemorrhage
","induction or stimulation of labor

the standard solution for infusion of oxytocin is prepared by adding the contents of one 1ml vial containing 10 units of oxytocin to 1000 ml of infusion fluids the combined solution containing 10 mu 1mu0001u of oxytocinml is rotated in the infusion bottle for thorough mixing
the initial dose should be 051 mumin equal to 36 ml of the dilute oxytocin solution per hour at 3060 minutes intervals the dose should be gradually increased in increments of 12 mumin until the desired contraction pattern has been established once the desired frequency of contractions has been reached and labor has progressed to 56 cm dilation the dose may be reduced by similar increments
at term higher infusion rates should be given with great care and rates exceeding 910 mumin are rarely required
before term when the sensitivity of the uterus is lower because of a lower concentration of oxytocin receptors a higher infusion rate may be required

control of postpartum uterine bleeding

intravenous infusion drip method to control postpartum bleeding 10 to 40 units of oxytocin may be added to the bottle depending on the amount of infusion fluids solution remaining maximum 40 units to 1000 ml adjust infusion rate to sustain uterine contraction and control uterine atony
intramuscular administration 1 ml 10 units of oxytocin can be given after the delivery of the placenta

treatment of incomplete or inevitable abortion

intravenous infusion of 10 units of oxytocin added to 500 ml of a 09 sodium chloride solution may help the uterus contract after a suction or sharp curettage for an incomplete inevitable or elective abortion
subsequent to intraamniotic injection of hypertonic saline prostaglandins urea etc for mid trimester elective abortion the injectiontoabortion time may be shortened by infusion of oxytocin at the rate of 10 to 20 mu 20 to 40 drops per minute the total dose should not exceed 30 units in a 12hour period due to the risk of water intoxication
","
hypersensitivity to the drug may result in uterine hypertonicity spasm titanic contraction or rupture of the uterus 
the possibility of increased blood loss and afbrinigenemia should be kept in mind when administering the drug
severe water intoxication with convulsions and coma has occurred 
oxytocin may occasionally cause nausea vomiting haemorrhage or cardiac arrhythmias anaphylactic reaction
",overdosage with oxytocin depends essentially on uterine hyperactivity whether or not due to hypersensitivity to this agent hyperstimulation with strong hypertonic or prolonged tetanic contractions or a resting tone of 15 to 20 mm h2o or more between contractions can lead to tumultuous labor uterine rupture cervical and vaginal lacerations postpartum hemorrhage uteroplacental hypoperfusion and variable deceleration of fetal heart fetal hypoxia hypercapnia or death water intoxication with convulsions which is caused by the inherent antidiuretic effect of oxytocin is a serious complication that may occur if large doses 40 to 50 muminute are infused for long periods management consists of immediate discontinuation of oxytocin and symptomatic and supportive therapy,store in between 2 to 8c in dark  frost free place keep out of the reach of children,['uterine atony antepartum induction labor patient medical indication initiation labor rh problem maternal diabetes pre eclampsia near term delivery best interest mother fetus membrane prematurely ruptured delivery indicated read morein antepartum induction labor patient medical indication initiation labor rh problem maternal diabetes pre eclampsia near term delivery best interest mother fetus membrane prematurely ruptured delivery indicated stimulation reinforcement labor selected case uterine inertia adjunctive therapy management incomplete inevitable abortion postpartum oxytocin indicated produce uterine contraction third stage labor control postpartum bleeding hemorrhage']

in the male male infertility treatment in combination with hcg induction of spermatogenesis in men deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophichypogonadism",to prevent painful injections and minimize leakage from the injection site rfsh should be slowly administered subcutaneously the subcutaneous injection site should be alternated to prevent lipoathrophy any unused solution should be discarded subcutaneous injection of rfsh may be carried out by patient or partner provided that proper instructions are given by the physician selfadministration of rfsh should only be performed by patients who are well motivated adequately trained and with access to expert advicedosage in female there are great inter and intraindividual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous gonadotrophins this makes it impossible to set an uniform dosage scheme the dosage should therefore be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response this requires ultrasonography and monitoring of estradiol levels there should be consideration to minimize the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation rfsh can be given either alone or in combination with a gnrh analogue to prevent premature luteinisation in the latter case especially when using a gnrh agonist a higher total treatment dose of rfsh may be required to achieve an adequate follicular response clinical experience with rfsh is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafterovulation induction in women starting daily dose of 75 international units iu of rfsh is administered subcutaneously or subcutaneous for at least the first 7 days the dose is increased by 25 or 75 international units iu at weekly intervals until follicular growth andor serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate response when an acceptable preovulatory state is achieved final oocyte maturation is achieved with 5000 to 10000 international units iu of human chorionic gonadotropin hcg the woman and her partner should have intercourse daily beginning on the day prior to the administration of hcg and until ovulation becomes apparentassisted reproductive technology art in women starting dose of 150 to 300 international units iu of rfsh is administered subcutaneous for at least the first 4 days of treatment subsequent doses are adjusted based upon ovarian response as determined by ultrasound evaluation of follicular growth and serum estradiol levels final oocyte maturation is induced with a dose of 500010000 international units of hcg oocyte egg retrieval is performed 34 to 36 hours laterpcos rfsh injections are therefore given each morning as a subcutaneous injection it is best to start with the lowest dose of rfsh per day using 75 iu per day these doses are used for 4 to 6 days at a time the ovarian response is determined by measuring estrogen levels in the blood when the estrogen begins to rise the rfsh is successfully growing an egg or eggs if there is no response to a dose of rfsh in 56 days of injections the dose will be increased the normal dose increments are 75 units 100 units 150 units and 300 units per day most patients respond with 75 iu to 150 iu per day however it is very important that increments are only made cautiouslydosage in male induction of spermatogenesis in men pretreatment with hcg alone 2500 international units twice weekly is required if serum testosterone levels have not normalized after 8 weeks of hcg treatment the dose may be increased to 5000 international units iu twice a week after normalization of serum testosterone levels administer 300 international units iu per week 300

as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation during routine induction and during rapid sequence induction when suxamethonium is contraindicated
to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery
as an adjunct in the intensive care unit icu to facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation
",dosage like other neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium should only be administered by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with the action and use of these agents the dosage of rocuronium should be individualized in each patient the method of anesthesia and the expected duration of surgery the method of sedation and the expected duration of mechanical ventilation the possible interaction with other medicines that are administered concomitantly and the condition of the patient should be taken into account when determining the dose the use of an appropriate neuromuscular monitoring technique is recommended for the evaluation of neuromuscular block and recovery inhalational anesthetics do potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of rocuronium this potentiation however becomes clinically relevant in the course of anesthesia when the volatile agents have reached the tissue concentrations required for this interaction consequently adjustments with rocuronium should be made by administering smaller maintenance doses at less frequent intervals or by using lower infusion rates of rocuronium during long lasting procedures longer than 1 hour under inhalational anesthesia in adult patients the following dosage recommendations may serve as a general guideline for tracheal intubation and muscle relaxation for short to long lasting surgical procedures and for use in the intensive care unit surgical procedures tracheal intubation the standard intubating dose during routine anesthesia is 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight after which adequate intubation conditions are established within 60 seconds in nearly all patients a dose of 10mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight is recommended for facilitating tracheal intubation conditions during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia after which adequate intubation conditions are also established within 60 seconds in nearly all patients if a dose of 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight is used for rapid sequence induction of anesthesia it is recommended to intubate the patient 90 seconds after administration of rocuronium bromide in patients undergoing caesarean section it is recommended to only use a dose of 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight since a 10mgkg dose has not been investigated in this patient group maintenance dosing the recommended maintenance dose is 015mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight in the case of longterm inhalational anesthesia this should be reduced to 007501mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight the maintenance doses should best be given when twitch height has recovered to 25 of control twitch height or when 23 responses to train of four stimulation are present continuous infusion if rocuronium bromide is administered by continuous infusion it is recommended to give a loading dose of 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight and when neuromuscular block starts to recover to start administration by infusion the infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain twitch response at 10 of control twitch height or to maintain 1 to 2 responses to train of four stimulation in adults under intravenous anesthesia the infusion rate required to maintain neuromuscular block at this level ranges from 0306mgkghr and under inhalational anesthesia the infusion rate ranges from 0304mgkghr continuous monitoring of neuromuscular block is recommended since infusion rate requirements vary from patient to patient and with the anaesthetic method used dosing in paediatric patients children 114 years and infants 112 months under halothane anesthesia manifest similar sensitivity to rocuronium bromide as adults onset of action is faster in infants and children than in adults clinical duration is shorter in children than in adults for continuous infusion in paediatrics the infusion rates with exception of children are the same as for adults for children higher infusion rates might be necessary for children the same initial infusion rates as for adults are recommended and this should be adjusted to maintain twitch response at 10 of control twitch height or to maintain 1 or 2 responses to train of four stimulation during the procedure there are insufficient data to support dose recommendations for the use of rocuronium bromide in neonates 01 month the experience with rocuronium bromide in rapid sequence induction in paediatric patients is limited rocuronium bromide is therefore not recommended for facilitating tracheal intubation conditions during rapid sequence induction in paediatric patients dosing in geriatric patients and patients with hepatic andor biliary tract disease andor renal failure the standard intubation dose for geriatric patients and patients with hepatic andor biliary tract disease andor renal failure during routine anesthesia is 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight a dose of 06mg per kg body weight should be considered for rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in patients in which a prolonged duration of action is expected regardless of the anesthetic technique used the recommended maintenance dose for these patients is 007501mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight and the recommended infusion rate is 0304mgkghr dosing in overweight and obese patients when used in overweight or obese patients defined as patients with a body weight of 30 or more above ideal body weight doses should be reduced taking into account ideal body weight intensive care procedures tracheal intubation for tracheal intubation the same doses should be used as described above under surgical procedures maintenance dosing the use of an initial loading dose of 06mg rocuronium bromide per kg body weight is recommended followed by a continuous infusion as soon as twitch height recovers to 10 or upon reappearance of 1 to 2 twitches to train of four stimulation dosage should always be titrated to effect in the individual patient the recommended initial infusion rate for the maintenance of a neuromuscular block of 8090 1 to 2 twitches to tof stimulation in adult patients is 0306mgkghr during the first hour of administration which will need to be decreased during the following 612 hours according to the individual response thereafter individual dose requirements remain relatively constant a large between patient variability in hourly infusion rates has been found in controlled clinical studies with mean hourly infusion rates ranging from 0205mgkghr depending on nature and extent of organ failures concomitant medication and individual patient characteristics to provide optimal individual patient control monitoring of neuromuscular transmission is strongly recommended administration up to 7 days has been investigated special populations rocuronium bromide is not recommended for the facilitation of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care in paediatric and geriatric patients due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy,"in clinical trials the most common adverse reactions 2 are transient hypotension and hypertension other are

anaphylaxis

although very rare severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents including rocuronium bromide have been reported anaphylacticanaphylactoid reactions are bronchospasm cardiovascular changes eg hypotension tachycardia circulatory collapse  shock and cutaneous changes eg angioedema urticaria these reactions have in some cases been fatal due to the possible severity of these reactions one should always assume they may occur and take the necessary precautions since neuromuscular blocking agents are known to be capable of inducing histamine release both locally at the site of injection and systemically the possible occurrence of itching and erythematosus reactions at the site of injection andor generalized histaminoid anaphylactoid reactions see also under anaphylactic reactions above should always be taken into consideration when administering these agents in clinical studies only a slight increase in mean plasma histamine levels has been observed following rapid bolus administration of 03 09mgkg rocuronium bromideprolonged neuromuscular block the most frequent adverse reaction to nondepolarizing blocking agents as a class consists of an extension of the agents pharmacological action beyond the time period needed this may vary from skeletal muscle weakness to profound and prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis resulting in respiratory insufficiency or apnoea myopathy myopathy has been reported after the use of various neuromuscular blocking agents in the icu in combination with corticosteroidslocal injection site reactions during rapid sequence induction of anesthesia pain on injection has been reported especially when the patient has not yet completely lost consciousness and particularly when propofol is used as the induction agent in clinical studies pain on injection has been noted in 16 of the patients who underwent rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with propofol and in less than 05 of the patients who underwent rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and thiopental",in the event of overdosage and prolonged neuromuscular block the patient should continue to receive ventilatory support and sedation in this situation there are two options for the reversal of neuromuscular block sugammadex can be used for reversal of intense profound and deep block the dose of sugammadex to be administered depends of the level of neuromuscular block an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor eg neostigmine edrophonium pyridostigmine with appropriate vagolytic eg atropine can be used at reappearance of t2 or at the first signs of clinical recovery and should be administered in adequate doses when administration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibiting agent fails to reverse the neuromuscular effects of rocuronium bromide ventilation must be continued until spontaneous breathing is restored repeated dosage of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor can be dangerous,rocuronium bromide should be stored in the refrigerator at 28 c and not be frozen,['muscle relaxant general anaesthesia rocuronium indicated adjunct general anesthesia facilitate tracheal intubation routine induction rapid sequence induction suxamethonium contraindicated provide skeletal muscle relaxation surgery adjunct intensive care unit icu facilitate intubation mechanical ventilation']

prevent the entry of venom into the circulation patient should be immediately taken to nearby medical centre for treatment without loss of time",as of now snake venom antiserum is the only specific antidote for snake envenomation and prompt administration of adequate dose of antiserum is of paramount importance for neutralization of unbound circulating snake venom components for early response to treatment any delay in administration may result in increased dose requirement and decreased effectiveness as the clinical signs can vary due to many factors such as type of snake time of reporting after bite size of snake amount of venom injected during bite seasonal  regional variation in venom composition etc no accurate dosage can be recommended however considering the average quantity of venom injected by snake at the time of bite and degree of envenomation it is recommended to administer initial dose of 510 vials of snake venom antiserum by slow intravenous infusion either undiluted at a speed of not more than 2 ml per minute or after dilution with normal glucose saline at a rate of 510 mlkg body weight over one hour children should receive the same dose as adults constant monitoring of the vital signs at frequent intervals during initial 1 hour is recommended requirement of further dosing depends on extent of reversal of coagulopathy confirmed after 6 hours of antiserum administration by wbct in haemotoxic bite or if symptoms persist or worsen or in respiratory failure in neurotoxic bite after 1 hour of antiserum administration if the blood is still in coagulable or no signs of reversal of paralysis are seen a further dose of 5 to 10 vials of antiserum should be administered by slow iv route only administration by im or locally around the bite wound is not recommended in the majority of cases of both neurotoxic and haemotoxic bites total dose of 1520 vials is adequate unless a proven recurrence of envenomation is established in such a scenario further doses can be given as per clinical condition of the patient hypersensitivity skin test has no predictability value and hence should not be used,snake venom antiserum being derived from equines is heterologous to human can give either early or late reaction adrenaline should be always kept handy before starting the dose of snake venom antiserum reduction in adverse reactions has been reported by use of adequate dilution of snake venom antiserum with saline and controlling rate of infusion,not available,lyophilized snake venom antiserum is stable at room temperature and does not

taken with food depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect the dose may be increased to 150 mgday if needed the dose should be further increased up to 225 mgday when increasing the dose increments of up to 75 mgday should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days in outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mgday for moderately depressed patients but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mgday certain patients including more severely depressed patients may therefore respond more to higher doses

dosages of vecuronium for surgical procedures after intubation with suxamethonium
recommended doses 

003 to 005 mg vecuronium bromide per kg body weight
if suxamethonium is used for intubation the administration of vecuronium should be delayed until the patient has clinically recovered from the neuromuscular block induced by suxamethonium

maintenance dosing 

the recommended maintenance dose is 002 to 003 mg vecuronium bromide per kg body weight these maintenance doses should best be given when twitch height has recovered to 25 of control twitch height
dose requirements for administration of vecuronium by continuous infusion
if vecuronium is administered by continuous infusion it is recommended to give a loading dose first see tracheal intubation and when neuromuscular block starts to recover to start administration of vecuronium by infusion the infusion rate should be adjusted to maintain twitch response at 10 of control twitch height or to maintain 1 to 2 responses to train of four stimulation in adults the infusion rate required to maintain neuromuscular block at this level ranges from 08 to 14 g vecuronium bromidekgmin for neonates and infants see below repeat monitoring of neuromuscular block is recommended since infusion rate requirements vary from patient to patient and with the anaesthetic method used


dosing in elderly patients

the same intubation and maintenance doses as for younger adults 00801 mgkg and 002003 mgkg respectively can be used however the duration of action is prolonged in elderly compared to younger subjects due to changes in pharmacokinetic mechanisms the onset time in elderly is similar to younger adults
in caesarean section and neonatal surgery the dose should not exceed 01 mgkg


dosing in paediatric patients
because of the possible variation of the sensitivity of the neuromuscular junction especially in neonates up to 4 weeks and probably in infants up to 4 months of age an initial test dose of 001 to 002 mg vecuronium bromide per kg body weight followed by incremental doses until 90 to 95 depression of twitch response is achieved is recommended in neonatal surgery the dose should not exceed 01 mgkg dose requirements in neonates and infants 112 months are the same as in adults however since the onset time of vecuronium in these patients is considerably shorter than in adults and children the use of high intubating doses in general is not required for early development of good intubating conditionssince the duration of action and recovery time with vecuronium is longer in neonates and infants than in children and adults maintenance doses are required less frequentlydose requirements in children 210 years are higher however the same intubation and maintenance doses as for adults 00801 mgkg and 002003 mgkg respectively are usually sufficient since the duration of action is shorter in children maintenance doses are required more frequentlyalthough there is very little information on dosage in adolescents it is advised to use the same dose as in adults based on the physiological development at this agedosing in overweight and obese patientswhen used in overweight or obese patients defined as patients with a body weight of 30 or more above ideal body weight doses should be reduced taking into account an ideal body weighthigher doses should there be reason for selection of larger doses in individual patients initial doses ranging from 015 mg up to 030 mg vecuronium bromide per kg body weight have been administered during surgery both under halothane and neurolept anaesthesia without adverse cardiovascular effects being noted as long as ventilation is properly maintained the use of these high dosages of vecuronium pharmacodynamically decreases the onset time and increases the duration of action",side effects are rare 11000 the most commonly occurring side effects include changes in vital signs and prolonged neuromuscular block the most frequently reported side effects during postmarketing surveillance is anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and associated symptoms reporting frequency 1100000,in the event of overdosage and prolonged neuromuscular block the patient should continue to receive ventilatory support and sedation upon start of spontaneous recovery an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor eg neostigmine edrophonium pyridostigmine should be administered in adequate doseswhen administration of an acetylcholinesteraseinhibiting agent fails to reverse the neuromuscular effects of vecuronium ventilation must be continued until spontaneous breathing is restored repeated dosage of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor can be dangerous,store between 2025 c protect from light,['skeletal muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide indicated adjunct general anaesthesia facilitate tracheal intubation provide skeletal muscle relaxation surgery']

parenteral administration

vitamin c is usually administered orally when oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected the drug may be administered im iv or subcutaneously when given parenterally utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after im administration and that is the preferred parenteral route
for intravenous injection dilution into a large volume parenteral such as normal saline water for injection or glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection
the average protective dose of vitamin c for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily in the presence of scurvy doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended however as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity
to enhance wound healing doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate although considerably larger amounts have been recommended in the treatment of burns doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury for severe burns daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended in other conditions in which the need for vitamin c is increased three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate
